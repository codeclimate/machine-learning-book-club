# Machine Learning Crash Course Book Club

This repo contains a work-in-progress curriculum for a machine learning book
club at Code Climate. It is based around Google's [machine learning crash
course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).

## Week 1: Pre-Requisites

### Before we meet

- Review [Prerequisites and Prework](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/prereqs-and-prework)
  and brush up on Python
- Read [Quick Introduction to pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/intro_to_pandas.ipynb?hl=en)
  and do the associated exercises
- Read [TensorFlow Hello World](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/hello_world.ipynb?hl=en)
  and do associated exercises
- Read [TensorFlow Programming Concepts](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/mlcc/tensorflow_programming_concepts.ipynb?hl=en)
